# Getting support and help

The easiest way to get help is to submit issues on **[GitHub]**. Please note
that I (Austin) have somewhat limited bandwidth to respond to all open source
inqueries, so please don't take a lack of action as a dismissal or anything.
Pinging me or contacting me should get things rolling.

If you find this code useful, or want proper, dedicated support and feature
development, maybe consider becoming a **[sponsor]** of my open source work.
